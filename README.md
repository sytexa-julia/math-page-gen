# Math Page Generator (2.0)

It generates randomized pages of elementary-level math problems for student practice or quizzing. 

## Status

This is an archived project. The executables still run in Windows 11, but it might take some configuration to get the project to build from source.
There was a Mac OS X-compatible build at one time that I am still trying to locate.

### Building

To my recollection, you will need wxWidgets, and a Visual C++ compiler.
